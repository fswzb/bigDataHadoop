# Knowledge Summary 
I divided what I learned priviously into several parts and summaried them in the file Knowledge Summary.pdf

# Topic folders
I classified the material that I learned and projects I worked into different folders based on the topics.
Some of the projects that I worked on come with 'neutronmobile' in the package name, or in some host name.
Neutron Mobile is the company I interned at last summer.
